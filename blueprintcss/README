h1. app-engine-patch users!!!

This is a version of Blueprint CSS adapted to the app-engine-patch media generator:
http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/wiki/MediaGenerator

You don't need to use Blueprint's CSS generator/compressor.

This is just a demonstration of the media generator, so you can learn how to use the paths. Take a look at settings.py to see how media files get combined.

This app can be uninstalled by simply removing 'blueprintcss' from INSTALLED_APPS in the root folder's settings.py.
